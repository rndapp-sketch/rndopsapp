"""
DPF diagnostic for a specific department head.

Run on the Frappe backend (NOT in this frontend repo — copy this file onto the bench host):

    bench --site prornd.local execute rndopsapp.debug_dpf_hodcivil.run --kwargs "{'user': 'hodcivil@iitg.ac.in'}"

or interactively:

    bench --site prornd.local console
    >>> from rndopsapp import debug_dpf_hodcivil
    >>> debug_dpf_hodcivil.run("hodcivil@iitg.ac.in")

Place this file wherever bench execute can import it (e.g. the app's top-level module dir),
or just paste the body into `bench console` directly.

What it checks, in order, mirroring the exact mint/scope logic in
docs/dpf-project-implementation.md sections 5.1 and 5.6:

  1. Does the user exist and what roles do they hold? (must include head_approver_1
     or one of the HoD/HoC/HoS role names for the "DPF" tab label / mint path to fire)
  2. Which Department_prornd row(s) list this user as dept_head — exact string match,
     the same equality Frappe uses server-side. Prints repr() so whitespace/case
     mismatches are visible instead of hidden by terminal trimming.
  3. For each such department: does a DPF balance exist / is it non-zero
     (probe endpoint), which is the has_fund_activity() gate that decides whether
     ensure_dpf_project ever mints a project row at all.
  4. Does a "Project Registration" row already exist for that department
     (project_no = DPF{dept_id}), and does its pi_webmail exactly equal the
     CURRENT dept_head — the doc explicitly warns this drifts when the head
     rotates and is not auto-reconciled except on ensure_dpf_project running.
  5. Sanity-check is_overhead_project / overhead_fund_type / overhead_scope_id /
     workflow_state / docstatus on that row.
  6. Whether head_approver_1 has been granted read/write/create/submit on the
     application doctypes per patchs/grant_head_application_access.py — a
     missing grant is the other documented failure mode (silent empty errors
     on Submit), separate from an invisible project row.

Nothing here writes or mutates anything. It only reads and prints.
